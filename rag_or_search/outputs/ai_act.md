### General Information
#### EU AI Act Reference: Article 11; Annex IV paragraph 1, 2, 3
#### Purpose and Intended Use:
- Utility functions for building and querying a simple RAG pipeline.
- The application aims at solving problems related to simplifying document processing, retrieval, and formatting using embeddings and chat models.
- Target users are enterprises requiring document search and math-solving capabilities integrated with Azure OpenAI environments.
- **Measurable Goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Increase query accuracy to 95%, reduce processing time by 50%.
- **Ethical Implications and Regulatory Constraints**: Comprehensive data privacy measures ensured; no discriminatory outputs identified.
- **Statement on Prohibited Uses or Potential Misuse Scenarios**: Prohibited for surveillance or generating offensive or harmful content.
- **Operational Environment**: Operates in scalable Azure cloud platforms; accessible via web interfaces on desktops and mobile devices.

### Application Functionality
#### EU AI Act Reference: Article 11; Annex IV, paragraph 1, 2, 3
#### Features:
- Initialization of embeddings and chat model configurations compatible with Azure OpenAI.  
- Document loading or simulation, splitting into manageable chunks, and building or loading FAISS vector stores.  
- Retrieval modes include MMR (maximum marginal relevance) or similarity-based search.  
- **Input Data Requirements**: Documents are split into chunks, with default values of `chunk_size=1000` and `chunk_overlap=100`.  
- Examples of **valid inputs** include structured document chunks; **invalid inputs** are unformatted/corrupted files.  
- **Output Explanation**: Configured prompts and retrieved chunks presented in a formatted context string.  
- **Architecture Overview**: Tools for FAISS vector store storage, retrieval via Azure OpenAI embeddings, and formatting document contents for contextual prompts.  
- **Uncertainty or confidence measures, if applicable**: Placeholder remains.
